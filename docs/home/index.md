This documentation is for developers and users of ONAP, an open source software platform that delivers robust capabilities for the design, creation, orchestration, monitoring, and life cycle management of Software-Defined Networks (SDNs).

ONAP (Open Network Automation Platform) is an open source software platform that delivers capabilities for the design, creation, orchestration, monitoring, and life cycle management of
 
* Virtual Network Functions (VNFs)
* The carrier-scale Software Defined Networks (SDNs) that contain them
* Higher-level services that combine the above

ONAP (derived from the AT&T's ECOMP) provides for automatic, policy-driven interaction of these functions and services in a dynamic, real-time cloud environment. ONAP is not just a run-time platform; it includes graphical design tools for function/service creation.

ONAP uses cloud technologies and network virtualization to offer services, achieving both faster development and greater operational automation. It lets service providers quickly add features and reduces operations costs. It gives service providers and businesses with their own network clouds more control of their network services, and enables developers to create new services. Ultimately, consumers benefit because the network better adapts, scales and predicts how to make their connected experiences seamless.
 
ONAP is mature, feature-complete, secure, and tested in real-world deployments. Releasing this software as open source, under the auspices of the Linux Foundation, creates a level playing field for carriers and equipment providers. By providing a common platform, ONAP has the potential to rapidly accelerate standardization and innovation across the cloud and networking ecosystems.
